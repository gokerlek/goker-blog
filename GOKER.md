This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First of all, if [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) node.js and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) are not installed, please install it.

Then download all the modules below with "npm install".

```json
 "dependencies": {
    "luxon": "^1.26.0",
    "mersenne-twister": "^1.1.0",
    "next": "10.0.8",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
    "react-icons": "^4.2.0",
    "react-markdown": "^5.0.3",
    "react-script": "^2.0.5",
    "react-syntax-highlighter": "^15.4.3",
    "styled-jsx": "^3.3.2"
  },
```

After the installations are finished

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## You can start now :)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Data Management With Forestry.io

You should use a [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) application that automatically generates a "JSON" file for project data.

You must map forestry.io to your git repository. [Check out](https://forestry.io/docs/git-sync/) for more information.

You can add and edit site data. For example, if you want to add a new page to the site, you will do it here. Likewise, if you want to add any content you will use "forestry.io".
