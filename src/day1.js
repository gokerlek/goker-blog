            <p>To create a Goker Blog project file, it is necessary to enter the projects file. I created my file in the projects folder by entering the commands below.
        </p>
            <p>cd projects
        </p>
            <p>npx create-react-app goker-blog
        </p>
            <p>To install the default react app in the goker blog file, go to the following command
        </p>
            <p>cd goker-blog
        </p>
            <p> npm start
        </p>
            <p> When the process is over, localhost: 3000 opens in the browser. The default react app works locally.
        </p>
            <p>Open a new terminal and enter the following commands.

        </p>
            <p>Thes, the app I created in VS opens.
        </p>
            <p>After that I opened a new repostroy on GitHub and mapped it to VS.
        </p>
            <p>Then I signed in to vercel.com with my github account.
        </p>
            <p>Then I uploaded my goker-blog project on github.
